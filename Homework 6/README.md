## Part 2

The free Splunk training that I did was Introduction to Enterprise Security. The training started by going over what enterprise security is. Enterprise security is made up of three functional areas: Perimeter Defense, Preventative Analysis, and Breach response. These are crucial because they go into detail about all the action required to stop incidents or immediately respond to them. Then it covered the Kill Chain. The Kill Chain is Delivery, Exploitation and Installation, Command and Control, and Accomplishment. This is vital to understanding how attacks work and how they develop on your network. It moved on to Advanced Persistent Threats. APTs are groups that function as nation-state actors that are devoted to working against their advarsaries. We must remain more advanced and prepared then they are. The ES workflow goes into detail on how you monitor potential threats on your network, specific things to look for, and how to respond effectively. Splunk flags notable events on your network. The urgency of each event is determined based off of your settings from your Assets and identities. The training then proceeds to go into depth on Splunk's UI, dashboards, and examples on how to search.
