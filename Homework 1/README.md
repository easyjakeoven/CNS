# Homework 1

## Provisioning the Machine
To provision the VM I started by creating my HTML directory and placing the homework.html file in it. Then I wrote the bootstrap.sh file in the box's directory, and then downloaded and installed the new box
onto my VirtualBox. I changed the code inside the VagrantFile to run the bootstrap, then ran the box. I then called the HTML inside the box.


## Configuring the Network
I went inside my VagrantFile and wrote out the new line of code telling the box where and how to host the HTML. I then reloaded my box, and was able to access my HTML file.
