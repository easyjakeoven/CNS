* Homework 3
1/c Jake Carpenter, CNS, 13 September 2023

** Completion on Linux
I decided to complete the homework on an Oracle VM. I created a homework 3 folder in my working directory, and I opened up the terminal and VirtualBox. I downloaded Oracle using vagrant, and SSHed into it.



** SCC Installation
I used the wget command followed with download link for the compressed SCC files. I then CDed into the SCC's directory and ran the .rpm file using RPM.


** Scan Results
  The scan results had an overall score of 35.39%. There were 86 passes and 157 fails. There were a total of 19 CAT I's, with 6 failing and 13 passing.
